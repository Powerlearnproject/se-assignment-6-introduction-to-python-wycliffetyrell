2. Installing Python:
   - Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.

   # Answer
   Windows:
   Download Python:

   Visit the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version of Python for Windows.
   Run the installer and ensure to check the box that says "Add Python [version] to PATH" during installation.
   Verify Installation:

   Open Command Prompt (cmd) and type python --version or python -V to check the installed Python version.
   Alternatively, you can run python in the command prompt to enter the Python interpreter.
   Set Up a Virtual Environment:

   Open Command Prompt and install the virtualenv package using pip install virtualenv.
   Navigate to your project directory and create a virtual environment using virtualenv venv.
   Activate the virtual environment by running venv\Scripts\activate.

3. Python Syntax and Semantics:
   - Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.

   # Answer
   
    print("Hello, World!")  # This line prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

    The print() function in Python is used to output data to the console. It accepts one or more arguments, which can be strings, variables, or expressions, and prints them to the standard output (usually the console).
   In this program, "Hello, World!" is passed as an argument to the print() function, causing it to print "Hello, World!" to the console.




4. Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.
   # Answer
   Integer (int):

   Represents whole numbers without any decimal point.
   Example: x = 10
   Floating-point number (float):

   Represents numbers with a decimal point or in exponential form.
   Example: y = 3.14
   String (str):

   Represents sequences of characters enclosed within single (') or double (") quotation marks.
   Example: name = "John"
   Boolean (bool):

   Represents one of two values: True or False.
   Used for logical operations and conditional statements.
   Example: is_valid = True
   List:

   Represents an ordered collection of items.
   Items can be of different data types and mutable (modifiable).
   Example: numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   Tuple:

   Similar to lists but immutable (cannot be modified after creation).
   Typically used to store related data together.
   Example: coordinates = (10, 20)
   Dictionary (dict):

   Represents a collection of key-value pairs.
   Keys are unique and immutable (usually strings or numbers).
   Example: person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}

   # code sample
   # Define variables of different data types
   integer_var = 10
   float_var = 3.14
   string_var = "Hello, World!"
   boolean_var = True
   list_var = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   tuple_var = (10, 20)
   dictionary_var = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}

   # Print the values and types of the variables
   print("Integer variable:", integer_var, type(integer_var))
   print("Float variable:", float_var, type(float_var))
   print("String variable:", string_var, type(string_var))
   print("Boolean variable:", boolean_var, type(boolean_var))
   print("List variable:", list_var, type(list_var))
   print("Tuple variable:", tuple_var, type(tuple_var))
   print("Dictionary variable:", dictionary_var, type(dictionary_var))


5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.
   # Answer
   Conditional Statements:
   Conditional statements in Python allow you to execute different blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false. The primary conditional statements are if, elif (else if), and else
   Example:
      x = 10

      if x > 5:
         print("x is greater than 5")
      else:
         print("x is not greater than 5")

   Loops:
   Loops in Python are used to execute a block of code repeatedly. The two main types of loops are for loops and while loops.
   Example:
      fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

      for fruit in fruits:
         print(fruit)



6. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.
   # Answer
   Functions in Python are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task. They allow you to break down your program into smaller, manageable pieces, making your code more organized, readable, and modular. Functions also promote code reusability and maintainability by avoiding redundancy and allowing you to use the same piece of code multiple times in different parts of your program

   example code
   def add_numbers(a, b):
    
    return a + b

    calling function
    # Call the add_numbers function with two arguments and store the result in a variable
   result = add_numbers(5, 3)

   # Print the result
   print("The sum of 5 and 3 is:", result)



7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.
   # Answer
   In Python, lists and dictionaries are both data structures used to store collections of elements, but they have different characteristics and use cases.

   Lists:
   Ordered Collection: Lists are ordered collections of elements, meaning the elements are stored in a specific sequence and can be accessed by their indices.
   Mutable: Lists are mutable, which means you can modify their elements after they've been created.
   Elements: Lists can contain elements of different data types (e.g., integers, strings, other lists).
   Access: Elements in a list are accessed using indices.
   Example: numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   Dictionaries:
   Key-Value Pairs: Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs, where each key is associated with a value. Keys are unique within a dictionary.
   Mutable: Dictionaries are mutable, allowing you to add, remove, or modify key-value pairs.
   Keys: Keys in a dictionary must be immutable objects (e.g., strings, numbers, tuples).
   Access: Elements in a dictionary are accessed using keys rather than indices.
   Example: person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}

   CODE SNIPPET
   # Create a list of numbers
   numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

   # Create a dictionary with key-value pairs
   person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}

   # Print the list and dictionary
   print("List of numbers:", numbers)
   print("Dictionary of a person:", person)

   # Access elements in the list by index
   print("Third number in the list:", numbers[2])

   # Access elements in the dictionary by key
   print("Name of the person:", person["name"])

   # Modify elements in the list
   numbers[0] = 10
   print("Modified list:", numbers)

   # Modify elements in the dictionary
   person["age"] = 35
   print("Modified dictionary:", person)

   # Add new elements to the list
   numbers.append(6)
   print("List with a new element:", numbers)

   # Add new key-value pairs to the dictionary
   person["occupation"] = "Engineer"
   print("Dictionary with a new key-value pair:", person)

   # Remove elements from the list
   numbers.remove(3)
   print("List with an element removed:", numbers)

   # Remove key-value pairs from the dictionary
   del person["city"]
   print("Dictionary with a key-value pair removed:", person)


8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.

   # Answer
   Exception handling in Python allows you to gracefully handle errors and exceptions that occur during the execution of your code. It helps prevent your program from crashing unexpectedly and allows you to handle errors in a controlled manner.

   Code example
   try:
    num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
    num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))
    result = num1 / num2
   except ZeroDivisionError:
      print("Error: Cannot divide by zero!")
   except ValueError:
      print("Error: Please enter valid integers!")
   else:
      print("Result of division:", result)
   finally:
      print("End of the program.")


9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.

   # Answer
   Modules:
   A module is a single Python file containing functions, classes, and variables that can be imported and used in other Python scripts.
   Modules allow you to organize related code into separate files, promoting code reuse and maintainability.
   You can create your own modules or use built-in modules provided by Python.
   Packages:
   A package is a collection of related modules grouped together in a directory.
   Packages allow for a hierarchical organization of modules, making it easier to organize and manage larger projects.
   Packages contain a special file called __init__.py, which indicates that the directory is a Python package.
   Packages can have sub-packages, which are simply nested directories containing their own modules and sub-packages.

   code sample
   import math

   # Calculate the square root of a number
   x = 16
   square_root = math.sqrt(x)
   print("Square root of", x, "is", square_root)

   # Calculate the factorial of a number
   y = 5
   factorial = math.factorial(y)
   print("Factorial of", y, "is", factorial)


10. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.

    #Answer
    To read from and write to files in Python, you can use the built-in functions open(), read(), readline(), write(), and close()

    sample code
    # List of strings to write to the file
   lines = ["Line 1\n", "Line 2\n", "Line 3\n"]

   # Open the file in write mode
   file_path = "output.txt"
   with open(file_path, "w") as file:
      # Write each string in the list to the file
      file.writelines(lines)

   print("Data written to", file_path)
